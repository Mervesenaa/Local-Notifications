# Local-Notifications

In this application, I wanted to show you how you can prepare local notifications in SwiftUI. 
You can see the images of this application, which is compatible with dark and light modes, in dark and light modes below.

I also shared the moment when the notification comes with a video for you. It's a bit slow because I had to reduce its size, but when you use the code you won't experience any slowness issues. Just below üëáüèº
